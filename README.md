## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### üì¶ Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or newer
- SQL Server Express (LocalDB also works), you should have sql express server instance named as localhost/sqlexpress, because connect string has been configured as "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=ExpenseDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
- Node.js V22.14.0 (installed automatically with VS workload)
- Npm 10.0.0
- .NET 8 SDK


### üß™ How to Run
1. Set the server project as the startup project, Run the server using **https** as follow, don't not use IIS express because I have configured to use https port for Api calls in Angular. This will also call npm to install all packages in Angular client project. You don't need to do anything. :)
2. Opent browser go to https://localhost:60888/, then UI will show as above as an expense list.
### Start the server
